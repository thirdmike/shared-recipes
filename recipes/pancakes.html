    <p>Time: 20 minutes</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups milk</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the griddle over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Mix together the dry ingredients. Beat the eggs into the milk.
            Gently stir this into the dry mix.</li>
        <li>Ladle batter onto the griddle, let cook on one side for 2-4 minutes
            until brown, then flip. When done, serve or hold on an ovenproof plate
            in 200&degF oven for up to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Note: this is the most basic version. For a slight increase in complexity,
            separate the eggs, mixing the yolks and milk into the dry mix, before whisking
            the egg whites until stiff, then folding the whites into the batter.</em></p>
